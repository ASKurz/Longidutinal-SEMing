Preface
=======

Newsome began the Preface with:

> This book is a thorough examination of structural equation modeling (SEM) strategies for longitudinal data. SEM is an analysis approach that combines path analysis and confirma- tory factor analysis, and its ability to model complex hypotheses and account for meas- urement error creates a truly remarkable, flexible method for analyzing data collected over time. The book is intended for advanced students or researchers in behavioral and social sciences and other related fields. Throughout the book readers will find examples relevant for students and researchers in psychology, gerontology, public health, sociology, educa- tion, social work, and economics. It is appropriate as a text for a second course in SEM or as a reference for researchers conducting longitudinal research. Familiarity is assumed with basic concepts of SEM, such as path analysis confirmatory factor analysis, model identification and fit, and general structural models. (p. xvii)

Reasons for ~~writing this book~~ making this project
-----------------------------------------------------

I recently started a 2-year postdoc. The folks in my workgroup have collected a lot of longitudinal data, which they tend to analyze with either OLS methods, or longitudinal SEMs. Though I have a background in longitudinal SEM, I was a little rusty at the outset and, after looking carefully at the structure of their data sets, it became clear that some of their analyses would require me to refresh myself on some analytic strategies I was either unfamiliar with or just hadn't done in a while.

In addition, I've learned through some of my [other projects](https://solomonkurz.netlify.com/bookdown/) that one of the best ways to learn is to reproduce the analyses in a text in R Markdown tutorials. The bonus, of course, is that others might then benefit from those tutorials. So this project has the dual purpose of refining my longitudinal SEM skills and perhaps helping others improve theirs, too.

Outline of the ~~book~~ project
-------------------------------

At present, I plan to follow the overall flow of the book. However, I expect I'll go on occasional tangents. I suspect I'll flesh this section out a bit once I'm further along in the project.

Acknowledgments
===============

I took a lot of statistics courses during [my graduate training at the University of Mississippi](https://psychology.olemiss.edu/clinical-program/). A few of them were taught by the inimitable [John Bentley](https://pharmacy.olemiss.edu/blog/team/dr-john-p-bentley/), who I've long considered my statistical mentor. So to John, thank you for your enthusiasm and your generous spirit.

Though this project is aimed at Newsom's text, I should also mention that my first comprehensive introduction to longitudinal SEM was with Todd Little's great text, [*Longitudinal Structural Equation Modeling*](https://www.guilford.com/books/Longitudinal-Structural-Equation-Modeling/Todd-Little/9781462510160). I definitely recommend you check it out.

Example Data Sets
=================

The data in this project, along with the author's Mplus and lavaan scripts, was downloaded from <http://www.longitudinalsem.com>. Here's how to do so in code.

``` r
dir.create(path = "data")

download.file(url      = "http://www.longitudinalsem.com/lsemdata.zip",
              destfile = "data/lsemdata.zip")

unzip(zipfile = "data/lsemdata.zip",
      exdir   = "data")
```

With `dir.create()`, we made a new folder, `data`, in our working directory. We then used `download.file()` to download the data from <http://www.longitudinalsem.com> and save them into our new `data` folder. Since the data came in a [ZIP file](https://www.howtogeek.com/178146/htg-explains-everything-you-need-to-know-about-zipped-files/), we then used `unzip()` to extract the files from the ZIP archive.

On the site, Newsome wrote: "In Mplus, locate data in the same folder as the syntax/input file. In lavaan, replace `<your director path>` with the location of your data file in the working directory command. For example, `setwd("c:/analyses/lsem")`. Before using lavaan for the first time on any computer, you will need to run the following line: `install.packages("lavaan", dependencies=TRUE)"`. Fair warning: Some within the R community have recommended against using `setwd()`. Jenny Bryan, for example, [has made her stance clear](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/):

> If the first line of your R script is

Do read her post in full to get the background, which endorses using [RStudio projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) (learn more about them, [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html)). To be clear, I should point out that this should not be read as an arson threat from yours truly. I'm just the messenger. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Back to Newsome, he gave some other helpful information in his webpage:

> Data files contain the same data sets used in the text (many of the data sets are used in more than one chapter). Data were simulated to closely correspond with the mean, variances, and covariances of several real data sets. See Example Data Sets at the front of the book for additional information. Syntax files were developed using Mplus versions 7.1 - 7.3 and the lavaan R package versions 0.5-16 and 0.5-18. All examples in the text are represented here. When variations on a particular model involve imposing constraints, only one example is given and notes on how to test the model variation are made in comments in the syntax. Examples in lavaan code are provided where current features allow. Binary ML and latent class analysis examples are only available in Mplus, for example. Thanks to Amanuel Zimam for help translating Mplus code to lavaan.

While we're at it, we might also download the lavaan files.

``` r
dir.create(path = "lavaan")

download.file(url      = "http://www.longitudinalsem.com/lsemr.zip",
              destfile = "lavaan/lsemr.zip")

unzip(zipfile = "lavaan/lsemr.zip",
      exdir   = "lavaan")
```

If you wanted to download the Mplus files, their url is "<http://www.longitudinalsem.com/lsemmplus.zip>".

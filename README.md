# Longidutinal Structural Equation Modeling with lavaan and the tidyverse

This project is based on Newsom's handy text, *Longitudinal structural equation modelling: A comprehensive introduction*. You can get the data and original [lavaan](http://lavaan.ugent.be/) code at the book's website, [http://www.longitudinalsem.com](http://www.longitudinalsem.com). I’m slowly going to through the text, largely for the work I do at my postdoc. The lavaan package has changed a bit since the book was published, so I’m updating that code as I go along.

I might eventually get around to stitching this together as an online book with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org). There's no anticipated completion date. Maybe in a few years. In the meantime, feel free to browse and make suggestions.
